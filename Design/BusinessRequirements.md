# Business Requirments
## Conner Prarie Pollinator Habitat Project

### BR1

*Simplify and digitize an existing educational activity about pollinators and their habitats, serving all age ranges and accessiblity levels.* 

Conner Prarie currently has an educational activity that teaches particpants about different pollinators. This is currently done on paper, which requires more overhead and setup. By providing a digitized version, Conner Prarie staff will no longer have to worry about sourcing, organizing, and providing paper handouts or materials. A digitized activity will also provide more accessible paths to activity materials for individuals with disabilities as well as all serve all age groups and individual backgrounds, to further embody Conner Prarie's *Eye for the Future* goal of establishing an environment of diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusivity. This application will provide the activity as a static fixture of the Conner Prarie's new *Food, Farm, and Energy Experience*

### BR2

*Collect, aggregate, and provide access to data about activity use, to provide valuable insight about activity participant trends.* 

The digitized application provides the opportunity to collect data and aggregate statistics about the use of the activity. The current paper implementation does not provide this opportunity. Per client request, this application will not collect **any** data about individual activity participants, not only to respect user privacy, but to eliminate the added overhead of data privacy regulatory compliance. By providing curated activity trends and insights, Conner Prarie can see how activity participants interact with their exhibits. By providing a means to access this data, Conner Prarie can make more informed decisions related to the activity and its use throughout its facilities and outreach.
