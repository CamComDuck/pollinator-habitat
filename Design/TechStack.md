# Tech Stack

## Programming Languages
The programming language for both back-end and front-end will be Typescript and JavaScript. This makes it easier to maintain because a developer only has to know one language to work on the application. 

## 1. Front-End 

### React  
We will use React SPA for this project because it makes it easier to interact with backend API's than having the backend send HTML and React makes it easier to implement Accessibility Features.

### Next.js 
We will use Next.js for this application to make routing easier as well as to improve performance for the user. 
Next.js will allow us to make the app perform better because the server can render the site for the client making the page faster for the users.

## 2. Back-End 

### Node.js 
Node.js will be used in this project to run the joint Back end and Front-End parts of the website. Node js is a good option because it has lots of third-party packages that allow us to have CSV data support for stats to be downloaded.

### MySQL 
MySQL relational database will be used to store the statistics data as well as Admins account information and the cards data.
