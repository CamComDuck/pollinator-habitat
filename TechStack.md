# TechStack Used #
## Programming Langauge ## 
The programming language for both back-end and front-end will be Typescript and Javascript. This makes it easier to maintain beacuse a developer only has to know one langauge to work on the application. 

## Front-End ##
### React ### 
We will use React SPA for this project beacuse it makes it easier to interact with backend API's than having the backend send HTML and and React makes it easier to implement Accessibility Features.

### Next.js ###
We will use Next.js for this application to make routing easier as well as to improve performance for the user. 
Next.js will allow us to make the app perform better beacuse the server can render the site for the client making the page faster for the users.

## Back-End ## 

### Node.js ### 
Node.js will be used in this project to run the joint Back-End and Front-End parts of the website. Node js is a good options beacuse it has lots of third party packages that allow us to have CSV data support for stats to be downloaded.
